A chest radiograph, often referred to as a chest X-ray, produces black and white images of the inside of the chest. The images capture various components such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, airways, and bones. These images are used in detecting various lung conditions such as cancer, infections, or other chronic conditions. These images can be taken over time and allow for doctors to analyze the progression of specific diseases. Additionally, as shown through several articles in the literature review, chest x-rays recently have been used in detecting Covid-19 especially with the presence of pneumonia.
